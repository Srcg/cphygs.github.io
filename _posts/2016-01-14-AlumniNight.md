Did you know there are careers outside of academia? Do you love Vancouver? Who doesnâ€™t! Well this night could be the night for you!  We have invited established UBC alumni working in relevant fields in Vancouver to share their experiences with you, in an informal setting.

We are planning to have this event mid-April in the evening (so that beer can be served!). Please stay tuned and let us know if you have an illustrious alumni that you think would like to participate.
