Hey CELL program and CPS department,
We are planning a Trivia Night for you guys to test your knowledge and have 
some well deserved fun. This event will occur in March, but the details have yet to 
be decided upon. If you have concerns, comments, or suggestions on how you would like the Trivia 
Night event to go down, please attend our bi-annual Open Meeting scheduled 
February 10th, 2016 in LSI 1330 at 1pm.

Best,

Your CPhyGS
